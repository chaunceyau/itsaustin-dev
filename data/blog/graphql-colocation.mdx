GraphQL is incredibly powerful, but also incredibly easy to use in the wrong ways. Let's explore one of those bad practices and how to avoid it.

# Fragments are misunderstood

Fragments are a powerful tool in GraphQL, but they're also one of the most misunderstood aspects of GraphQL. Developers often point to "being able to re-use the fragment in multiple places and not needing to repeat yourself."

We've always been taught to avoid duplicated logic in our codebase, e.g. DRY - don't repeat yourself, but there's little-to-no benefit to reusing fragments in this way - and usually steers us to bad patterns.


The primary benefit of fragments is being able to define a subset of fields on a GraphQL operation, corresponding
to a component's data requirements and then compose those fragments into a root query or mutation. This
pattern is the primary way to use GraphQL in the [Relay](relay.dev) client library.

- Independently define and evolve component data dependencies
  - When using fragments to be "DRY", you likely will affect other components that need that data
  - Adding a new field to the fragment only affects that single component, avoiding overfetching
  - Remove an existing field to the fragment only affects that single component, avoiding underfetching
  - Data dependencies are colocated with components, making them easy to find and reason about
- Compose fragments to top-level queries

  - This type of fragment "re-use" is great, i.e. reusing to compose queries in different places that components are rendered.
  - When a component is rendered in multiple places, this pattern makes it easy to compose those data requirements to mutliple top-level queries
  - Composition can be happen in multiple levels, i.e. a component can be constructed from multiple fragments, which can be nested
- Codegen strong type definitions specific to the component

# Example

```ts
// some-container.ts
export function SomeContainer() {
  const data = useQuery(SomeContainer.query)
  return (
    <div>
      <Avatar avatar={data.user.avatar} />
    </div>
  )
}

SomeContainer.query = gql`
  query SomeContainer {
    user {
      id
      ...Avatar_user
    }
  }
`

// avatar.ts
export function Avatar({ avatar }: { avatar: FragmentType<typeof Avatar.fragments.avatar> }) {
  return <img src={user.avatar.url} alt={alt} />
}

Avatar.fragments = {
  avatar: gql`
    fragment Avatar_user on User {
      avatar {
        id
        alt
        url
      }
    }
  `,
}
```
